# Basic-Portfolio
This was built from scratch, starting the Sunday after our first Saturday class. There was a lot we hadn't yet gone over, but I felt that positioning and basic CSS should've been enough. 

I am unsure if it was prudent to place the video solution of the portfolio homework out in Gitlab, prior to that homeworks' due date. I refused to look at it prior to finishing, as I wanted to try and figure it out on my own.

After I viewed the video, I realized that there was quite a bit of coding that the video instructor was doing that we had never been exposed to, like nth child, the idea of placing the portfolio images in an unordered list, etc. Viewing the video prior to starting basically gives it all away.

That being stated, I think I did pretty well.
